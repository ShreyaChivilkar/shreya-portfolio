  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    I am a Master’s student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech
    with over three years of industry experience as a Software Engineer in the
    financial services domain.
  </p>

  <p>
    My professional background includes designing and building scalable
    microservices, real-time data pipelines, and risk systems used by traders.
    In parallel, I work on applied machine learning research in healthcare,
    spanning causal inference, deep learning, and signal processing.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am currently seeking Software Engineering and Machine Learning roles where
    I can contribute to building reliable systems and impactful data-driven
    products.

    <span class="experience-meta">May 2025 – Aug 2025 · Massachusetts, USA</span>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Built an interactive analyzer for shared object (.so) files in Python to
        map 700+ function symbols across 60+ DLLs, applying TF-IDF and Agglomerative
        Clustering to identify modular refactoring opportunities.
      </li>
      <li>
        Engineered a graph partitioning framework using Louvain and Kernighan–Lin
        algorithms, reducing cross-component coupling by 30%.
